# PINS
Pinterest Image Network Survey. This tool is designed to take the input of a mass scanned pinterest image capture. It gives IDs, prints them at the top of the post, and exports a basic XLSX map of the IDs. This is designed for people doing studies on Pinterest and need to do mapping/manual coding. 

Dependancies:
python: 
- pip install PILLOW
- pip install xlsxwriter
